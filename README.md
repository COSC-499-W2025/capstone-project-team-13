## üéØ Project Overview

Our digital artifact mining software serves as a tool for new graduates and students to efficiently display their projects, skills, and highlights. The system supports three different user groups:

1. **Programming/Technology** - Analyzes code files, detects languages and frameworks
2. **Digital Art/Graphics** - Processes media files, identifies design software and skills
3. **Writing/Research** - Extracts keywords and insights from documents

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Current (Milestone 1)
- **Language:** Python
- **Database:** SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Testing:** pytest, unittest
- **Libraries:**
  - `rake-nltk` - Keyword extraction
  - `nltk` - Natural language processing
  - `Pillow` - Image/media analysis
  - `sqlalchemy` - Database ORM

### Planned (Milestones 2 & 3)
- **Web Framework:** Django
- **Frontend:** Django templates or React
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (development)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Architecture

The system will use **two separate SQLite databases**:

#### Database 1: `projects_data.db` - Raw Project Data
Stores extracted information from scanned projects:
- **Projects** - Basic info, dates, metrics, type, languages, frameworks
- **Files** - File paths, types, sizes, created/modified dates
- **Contributors** - Git contributor names, identifiers, commit counts

#### Database 2: `projects_analysis.db` - Analysis Results
- **Coming soon...*
