This week, we focused on establishing functional and non-functional requirements for our project. For functional requirements, I proposed that we should create a user dashboard to keep user artifacts and data organized. The requirements I created are as follows: 
Users can view a dashboard summarizing their uploaded artifacts and analytics
 Users can filter artifacts by type, date, creativity score, or productivity score etc. 
Dashboard should show weekly summaries of activity. 

For the non-functional requirements I emphasized that the system should remain secure and reliable. A key to a successful system and earning your user’s trust is having a system that keeps one’s data secure. The requirements I created are as follows: 
Authentication should follow standard practices (encryption, hashed passwords etc.)
 There should be backup mechanisms to prevent data loss/restoration during analysis.
