This week we were working on our project requirements, since we had to submit them and bring printed copies to class. I focused on setting up our group by making a groupchat and google docs to ensure we were set up as a group, as well as the user stories. I also focused on setting up the git repository team/individual log folder.

This week our main focus was completing the System Architecture Diagram, as we were required to submit and bring printed copies to class for discussion. I focused on refining the diagram to ensure it aligned with the System Architecture Design Checklist, making sure all requirements were clearly addressed. As well, I contributed to the Project Proposal by researching and evaluating different technology stack options to determine the best fit for our project.
