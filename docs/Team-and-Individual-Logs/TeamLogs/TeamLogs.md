# Team Logs

## Weeks 3 - Sept 15-21, 2025
The features included in this milestone were to work together as a group, setting up necessary documentation such as google drive folder, setting up our capstone repository to work on our individual and team logs, working on our project requirements, and creating a project backlog within our repository. Due to the early stages of the project, the rest is unable to be done at the moment.

## Week 4 - Sept 22-28, 2025
The features for this week’s milestone was to revisit our project requirements, and construct our software architecture diagram. Collectively, each of our team members contributed to refining the requirements for our project, as well as discussing and suggesting ideas for the different components in our system architecture diagram. Additionally, our team worked on our project proposal/project plan document, in which we specified our tech stack, functional requirements, and assigned tasks to each of our team members. 


## Week 5 - Sept 29 - Oct 5, 2025
This week, our team revisited the project requirements and worked on developing our Data Flow Diagram (DFD) as part of clarifying the system design. We collaborated on refining the components, discussing how data, processes, and flows would be represented in the diagram. In addition, we continued drafting the project proposal and plan, where we outlined our tech stack, functional requirements, and assigned tasks to each member.
