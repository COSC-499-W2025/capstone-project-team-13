# Team Logs

## Weeks 3 - Sept 15-21, 2025
The features included in this milestone were to work together as a group, setting up necessary documentation such as google drive folder, setting up our capstone repository to work on our individual and team logs, working on our project requirements, and creating a project backlog within our repository. Due to the early stages of the project, the rest is unable to be done at the moment.

## Week 4 - Sept 22-28, 2025
The features for this week’s milestone was to revisit our project requirements, and construct our software architecture diagram. Collectively, each of our team members contributed to refining the requirements for our project, as well as discussing and suggesting ideas for the different components in our system architecture diagram. Additionally, our team worked on our project proposal/project plan document, in which we specified our tech stack, functional requirements, and assigned tasks to each of our team members.

This week, our team revised and made changes to our system architecture diagram, and data flow diagrams, reflecting the finalized project requirements. We also divided up the first few functions of our backend that we needed to implement, and assigned them to each of our team members, as well as updated our github repository. Some functions that our team started developing are checking file formats, distinguishing individual projects from collaborative projects, adding permissions to collect and analyze the users data, as well as permissions to use external services for analysis. Our team also worked on developing a “testConsole” skeleton to test our functions.
