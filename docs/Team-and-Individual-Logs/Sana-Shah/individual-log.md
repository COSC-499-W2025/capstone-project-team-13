### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

Our group worked together on the project requirements document for this week. I contributed to the document in the requirements section and contributed ideas to usage sceanrios. Our group collaboratively provided different ideas on the project, usage scenarios, as well as potential requirements and feautures. I also contributed ideas to the architecture of the project, such as how it would be set up, as well as ways of implementation.

Our group also completed the project requirements surveys, and helped each other in the process.
