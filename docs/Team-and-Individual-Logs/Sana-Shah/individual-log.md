Our group worked together on the project requirements document for this week. I contributed to the document in the requirements section and contributed ideas to usage sceanrios. Our group collaboratively provided different ideas on the project, usage scenarios, as well as potential requirements and feautures. I also contributed ideas to the architecture of the project, such as how it would be set up, as well as ways of implementation.

Our group also completed the project requirements surveys, and helped each other in the process.

### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

This week our team worked on the level 0 and level 1 Data Flow diagrams. Some features that I contributed to this week was developing the level 1 data flow diagram. Our team split into 2 subgroups, with one group working on the level 0 data flow diagram and the other working on the level 1 diagram. Our group accidently made 2 level 1 data flow diagrams, so I reviewed both diagrams to spot differences and compare, which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of components we should change, add, or remove. Additionally, I brought printed copies of the level 1 data flow diagram to class.
