### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

Our group worked together on the project requirements document for this week. I contributed to the document in the requirements section and contributed ideas to usage sceanrios. Our group collaboratively provided different ideas on the project, usage scenarios, as well as potential requirements and feautures. I also contributed ideas to the architecture of the project, such as how it would be set up, as well as ways of implementation.

Our group also completed the project requirements surveys, and helped each other in the process.

### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

This week our team worked on the System Architecture Diagram, as well as the project proposal/project plan document. Some features that I contributed to this week was constructing a template for the system architecture digram, and reviewing and adjusting it, following the System Architecture Design Checklist. Some feautures that I contributed to on the Project Proposal document was the project scope, proposed solution, use cases and the test frameworks. Additionally, I contributed to the team log for this week.

### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

This week our team worked on the level 0 and level 1 Data Flow diagrams. Some features that I contributed to this week was developing the level 1 data flow diagram. Our team split into 2 subgroups, with one group working on the level 0 data flow diagram and the other working on the level 1 diagram. Our group accidently made 2 level 1 data flow diagrams, so I reviewed both diagrams to spot differences and compare, which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of components we should change, add, or remove. Additionally, I brought printed copies of the level 1 data flow diagram to class.

### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

This week, I worked on deciding on an official tech stack with the rest of my team, incorporating the finalized project requirements. Additionally, I uploaded the data flow diagram and software architecture diagram, as well as the descriptions in our github repository and linked them on the main readMe file, and worked on the team log for this week. My team and I also decided to divide setting up functions for the backend of our project. The python function that I developed requires the user to either allow or deny our system to use external services, such as artificial intelligence/LLM’s to analyze their data. The function starts by prompting the user with a description on why permissions are needed, and then allows the user to either enter “yes” or “no”, on which the system is exited.

### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

This week my team and I continued to implement different functions for parts of our system. I worked on coding the function that analyzes a given media project containing graphics, images or other visual digital artifacts, and extracts insights from each of the files in the folder. The function outputs the number of files, top skills such as 3d rendering, photoshop, etc, as well as different softwares that were used. 
I am currently in progress of conducting research on the best ways for our team to implement the database for our system.
For this upcoming week, my focus will be to implement the database for our system to store processed metadata, and files.

### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?

This week my team and I continued to work on different backend functions of our system. This past week, I worked on researching and implementing a function that would intake coding project folders with files, and somehow, output an ordered list of skills exercised/practiced in their project. The way my function works is by iterating through each file in the given project folder, reading the source code, and analyzing its contents using predefined keyword mappings related to programming languages, frameworks, and technical domains. It then calculates a relevance score for each detected skill, normalizes the results, and returns a structured list ranking the most prominent skills demonstrated in the project.
I also added test cases that test different parts of the function, such as different keywords in different projects, the normalizing scores part of the function, and also iterating through files in a folder.

### In-Progress Tasks

Currently a function that I am working on implementing is a function that takes in a folder of files for a document project, that analyzes the files, and results in a list of skills exercised/practiced in the project. 

### Upcoming cycle

For this upcoming cycle, I plan on completing my function that produces a list of skills for a document project. Additionally, I plan to start working on 1 of 3 more functions that analyzes different project types (media, code, and documents), and produce contribution metrics, depending on whether the projects are a solo vs collaborative projects.
