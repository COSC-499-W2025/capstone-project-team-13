There wasn't really enough to go off of in terms of
deliverables for the week. The team got together and 
all completed the quiz/assignment as well as the in class
exercises such as the functional requirements comparison 
in class.

This week was primarily the System Architecture Diagram considering it was the focus of class with the exercise in which we compared with classmates. I created the revised version of the diagram after said class, cleaning up the looks and encompassing more of the project rather than the more streamlined list we had before. Outside of this, I contributed with the rest of the group to the project proposal, creating the use case diagram and providing input for the written content.
