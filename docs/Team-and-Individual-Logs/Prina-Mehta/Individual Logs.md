## Recap on your week's goals

During this period, our team discussed and refined the functional and non-functional requirements for the project. My personal focus was on researching similar projects online to better understand common requirements and best practices that could be relevant to our work. This helped me think critically about what features might be necessary and what constraints we should consider. My goals for the week were mainly to contribute to shaping our requirements document and ensure I had enough context to give meaningful input.

## Recap on your week's goals

This week, I worked closely with my team on building the system architecture and developing the project proposal. My main contributions included identifying and listing all the use cases for our system, as well as creating the workload distribution table to ensure tasks were divided fairly and efficiently among team members. I also took part in every team meeting, where I actively contributed to discussions, shared ideas, and provided feedback.

This week, I helped design the Data Flow Diagram by creating the processes and mapping out how data moves between them. I worked on building the diagram in Figma, making sure it was clear, well-organized, and visually consistent with our project standards.

## Recap on your week's goals

This week, I updated the Kanban board and, together with Maya, assigned tasks to everyone in the group. I also attended the team meeting on Monday. On the development side, I added a zip file handler and created as well as reviewed and approved pull requests on GitHub. I also researched which frameworks would be best suited for our project.

## Recap on your week's goals

This week, I worked on issue #2 on the Kanban board. I focused on building the feature that prompts users to enter a file path and then processes the file based on its format. The system can now handle multiple file types including `.csv`, `.json`, `.txt`, `.py`, and `.zip`. It also automatically performs the correct parsing or reading operations for each. Additionally, I implemented detailed error handling to manage invalid inputs and potential edge cases, along with unit tests to verify that the feature behaves reliably across scenarios. For next week, I plan to implement functionality for storing user configurations and start analyzing project files to extract useful insights and support upcoming features.
