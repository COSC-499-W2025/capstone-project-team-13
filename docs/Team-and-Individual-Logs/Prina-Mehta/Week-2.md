## Recap on your week's goals

This week, I worked closely with my team on building the system architecture and developing the project proposal. My main contributions included identifying and listing all the use cases for our system, as well as creating the workload distribution table to ensure tasks were divided fairly and efficiently among team members. I also took part in every team meeting, where I actively contributed to discussions, shared ideas, and provided feedback.
