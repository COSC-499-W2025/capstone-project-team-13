#Week3 (Log 1)

This week, we focused on establishing functional and non-functional requirements for our project. For functional requirements, I proposed that we should create a user dashboard to keep user artifacts and data organized. The requirements I created are as follows: 
Users can view a dashboard summarizing their uploaded artifacts and analytics
 Users can filter artifacts by type, date, creativity score, or productivity score etc. 
Dashboard should show weekly summaries of activity. 

For the non-functional requirements I emphasized that the system should remain secure and reliable. A key to a successful system and earning your user’s trust is having a system that keeps one’s data secure. The requirements I created are as follows: 
Authentication should follow standard practices (encryption, hashed passwords etc.)
 There should be backup mechanisms to prevent data loss/restoration during analysis.

*Tasks Completed / In Progress (Past Two Weeks):*
Contributed to team discussion and documentation for project requirements
Created dashboard functional requirements.
Got feedback from other teams and added useful suggestions to our project layout.
Drafted non-functional requirements for security and reliability.

#Week4 (Log 2)

This week, I focused on the system architecture design and project planning. For the architecture document, I outlined how the system would be separated into layers (UI, business logic, and data) and documented considerations for scalability and performance, such as batch processing and having different file size limits to make data processing managaeable. I also emphasized simplicity and communication, which was reflected in the Figma diagram created for the design.

For the project plan and proposal diagram, I researched suitable tools and technologies. On the frontend, I looked at the functionality and compatability of Electron and React and concluded they would work well for out project because they integrate smoothly with backend services, support cross-platform development, and offer strong testing support.. For testing, I explored frameworks like Jest and Playwright for frontend, backend, and API testing. I also compared  different options such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL.  I also compared different options such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. I concluded PostgreSQL would be the best choice because it offers stronger support for handling complex data types and queries, which is important since our system will need to process and analyze diverse digital artifacts (documents, media, and code) and extract metadata efficiently. PostgreSQL’s robustness works well for generating summaries, highlights, and productivity metrics. And since its syntax is very similar to SQL, which our team is already familiar with, the transition will be smooth. Lastly, I signed up for a set of easy, medium, and hard tasks outlined in our project proposal that I will be completing throughout the course of the project.

*Tasks Completed (Past Week):*

Contributed to the System Architecture Design Document (layers, scalability, communication).
Details from the System Architecure document was smoothly translated into the Figma design document. 
Researched frontend tools (Electron, React).
Researched testing tools (Jest, Playwright).
Compared databases and came to a conclusion on the best fit.
Signed up for easy, medium, and hard tasks in the project proposal.

#Week5 (Log 3)
Date Range: Sept 29 – Oct 5, 2025

This week, I focused primarily on the development and review of our Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), system architecture refinements, and completing the final touches on our team’s project proposal.

Tasks Worked On:
- Collaborated with the team to build the Level 0 and Level 1 Data Flow Diagrams using Draw.io and Figma.
-Double-checked formal notation and labelling to ensure that all inputs and outputs matched across levels, and referenced with DFD requirements.
- Reviewed other teams’ DFDs during Wednesday’s class session provided feedback and also took some valuable insights. For example, I noted that our diagram explicitly showed distinct data stores and categories (Processed Data, Analytics Stores, Selected Filters), whereas another team focused on roles (e.g., Admin, Project Manager) instead of the actual flow of data. My feedback emphasized that our balanced approach aligned well with the purpose of a DFD — visually summarizing flows without overloading with explanations.
-Supported final revisions of the System Architecture document, ensuring consistency between layers and communication flows.
- Helped complete and submit the team’s project proposal.

Recap of Goals / Progress:
- Features assigned to me this milestone: Contributions to the DFD design and system architecture documentation.
- Project board association: My work connects to tasks like “Submit DFD” (#4) and “Submit team’s project proposal” (#1).
- Progress in last 2 weeks: The proposal task has been completed and submitted. The DFD diagram and reflection has also been successful completed and submitted. Everyone has been co-operating well with one another and has been communicating in a clear and timely manner.
