## 1. Project Scope and Usage Scenario

Our digital artifact mining software will serve mostly as a tool for new graduates, and students that want an efficient way to display their projects, skills, and highlights about their digital artifacts. The usage scenario that we intend to cover is multiple user groups from different areas of work or interest. The user groups include individuals in areas of technology/programming, digital art/graphics, as well as writing/researching. The system will support 3 different forms or types of digital artifacts, which include documents (pdfs, docx, etc.), media (images, designs, digital graphics), and programming/coding files. Based on the area of interest the user is from, and the type of digital artifact that they input, the system will perform different methods of extracting the metadata and analyzing the digital artifact to produce an output with highlights, and summaries.


## 2. Proposed Solution

Our solution is a versatile digital artifact mining platform that intelligently processes different types of user submissions, including documents, media, and code, to create polished summaries and highlights. Unlike generic portfolio or storage tools, our system leverages automated metadata extraction and content analysis to save users time and effort in collecting, organizing and presenting their work. For example, it can identify and summarize key themes in a research paper, highlight standout design features in a graphic, or detect coding practices and patterns in a software project. By tailoring its analysis to the type of artifact and field of interest, our tool produces meaningful, context-aware outputs that elevate the way users present their skills.

The value proposition lies in our focus on adaptability and personalization: instead of being limited to a single domain, the system accommodates multiple professional and academic disciplines. Compared to other teams, we aim to deliver a more comprehensive solution that blends technical precision with user-centric design, helping students and graduates stand out in competitive job markets by showcasing their work in a structured, and easy-to-use format.
