## 📝 Description

Similarly to keywordExtractorText, this is to create a very quick evaluation of code by analyzing comments and extracting important keywords of it. The functionality is roughly the same, and testing manually can be done through testConsole.py. To properly run, install code-to-text with:

`pip install code-to-text`

**Closes:** # 66
