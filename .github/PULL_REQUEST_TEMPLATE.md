## 📝 Description

Refactored getConsent.py so that functions could be called independently. Created testConsole.py in order to give us a temporary "dashboard" to test functions. Once we have a framework set up, this file will be replaced with something more permanent. 

Also added the PR template folder as we hadn't had that set up yet. It was more of an afterthought to this PR but felt it would be fine to just bundle together.

**Closes:** # 33
